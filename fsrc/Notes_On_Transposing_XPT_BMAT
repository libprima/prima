In NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA, Powell defined XPT as an NPTxN matrix,
each row containing the coordinates of an interpolation point, and BMAT
as an (NPT+N)xN matrix containing the last N columns of H. As
a consequence, in calculation, we access more often the rows of XPT and 
BMAT than their columns. For XPT, this is quite natural as each of its 
rows corresponds to an interpolation point; BMAT can indeed be written 
as [B1; B2] using a MATLAB-style notation, where B1 has a size of NPTxN, each row
corresponding to an interpolation point, while B2 is an NxN symmetric matrix.  

To improve the efficiency of accessing XPT and BMAT, we decided to
revise the code by transposing them. XPT and BMAT in the revised code
are respectively the transposes of the matrices with the same names in
the original code. 

To this end, here are the major changes.

0. XPT(i, j) ==> XPT(j, i)
   BMAT(i, j) = BMAT(j, i)
1. matmul(XPT, v) ==> matmul(v, XPT)
   matmul(BMAT, v) ==> matmul(v, BMAT)
2. BMAT = BMAT + outprod(u, v) ==> BMAT = BMAT + outprod(v, u)
3. XPT = XPT + spread(x, dim = 1, ncopies) ==> XPT = XPT + spread(x, dim = 2, ncopies)
4. sum(XPT, dim = 2) ==> sum(XPT, dim = 1)

An important thing to note is that QALT takes only part of BMAT (indeed,
the first NPT columns in the new code; QALT calls it SMAT) as the input.
So it is not enough to search for BMAT and change only the related parts. 
SMAT should also be revised.

It is unrealistic to finish all the changes at one time. We have to
revise the files one by one, and verify the revision before continuing
with another file. To this end, we implemented the changes in the
following way. We take XPT as an example.

Step 1. Revising all the subroutine other than newuob.f and initialize.f

1.1. In each subroutine except for newuob.f and initialize.f, define
a new variable XPR of size NxNPT. At the very beginning of each
subroutine, after declaring the variables, define 

XPR = transpose(XPT) 

If XPT is an output of this subroutine, then put also 

XPT = transpose(XPR)

right before the subroutine returns.

1.2. Replace all the XPT below the above line by XPR except for the XPT
     that are passed to other subroutines.  

1.3. If XPT is passed to another subroutine, put

XPT = transpose(XPR)

right above the line that invokes the subroutine. The idea is indeed the
same same as putting the same instruction before the return.

1.4. For each XPR, change XPR(i, j) to XPR(j, i), matmul(XPR, v) to
   matmul(x, XPR), matmul(v, XPR) to matmul(XPR, v), spread(XPR dim = 1)
   to spread(XPR, dim =2), sum(XPR, dim = 2) to sum(XPR, dim = 1) ...

1.5. After finishing the above changes in a subroutine, compile it and
   verify whether the changes are correctly made by checking whether the
   code produce EXACTLY the same results as before.

The reason for introducing XPR is to keep the changes local --- we do
not need to change how the subroutine interfaces with others.

Step 2. Revise newuob.f

2.1. In newuob.f, define a new variable XPR of size NxNPT. Right after the
initialization finishes (i.e., after calling initialize()), put 

XPR = transpose(XPT)

2.2. Then replace all the XPT below the above line by XPR.

2.3. For each XPR, change XPR(i, j) to XPR(j, i), matmul(XPR, v) to
   matmul(x, XPR), matmul(v, XPR) to matmul(XPR, v), spread(XPR dim = 1)
   to spread(XPR, dim =2), sum(XPR, dim = 2) to sum(XPR, dim = 1) ...

2.4. For each subroutine called by newuob, change the declaration of XPT
    to 

real (kind=??), intent(??) :: XPT(N, NPT)

If the subroutine contains 

XPR = transpose(XPT)
or
XPT = transpose(XPR)

remove the transpose.


2.5. After finishing the above changes in newuob.f and the subroutines
   called by newuob, compile and verify whether the changes are
   correctly made by checking whether the code produce EXACTLY the same
   results as before.

Step 3. Revise initialize.f

3.1. For each XPT, change XPT(i, j) to XPT(j, i), matmul(XPT, v) to
   matmul(x, XPT), matmul(v, XPT) to matmul(XPT, v), spread(XPT dim = 1)
   to spread(XPT, dim =2), sum(XPT, dim = 2) to sum(XPT, dim = 1) ...

3.2. In newuob.f, remove the transpose in

XPR = transpose(XPT)

3.3. After finishing the above changes, compile and verify whether the
   changes are correctly made by checking whether the code produce
   EXACTLY the same results as before.

4. Finish the revision.

4.1. In all the subroutines, remove the declaration of XPR, and the
   replace all the XPR by XPT, and remove all the lines that are 

   XPT = XPT

4.2. Compile and verify that the changes are correctly made. 


The revision for BMAT is similar. One has to pay particular attention to
the outer products in the update of BMAT.
