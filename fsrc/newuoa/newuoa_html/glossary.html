The cyclomatic complexity is also the number of basis, or independent, paths through a module. Sometimes also called the "McCabe Complexity" after its originator.<br> <i><u>For a precise definition see:</u></i><br> NIST Special Publication 500-235 Structured Testing:<br> A Testing Methodology Using the Cyclomatic Complexity Metric<br> <a href="http://hissa.ncsl.nist.gov/sw_assurance/strtest.html">http://hissa.ncsl.nist.gov/sw_assurance/strtest.html</a><p><a name="Decls"><strong>Declarations</Strong></a>: total number of declarations<p><a name="Essential"><strong>Essential Complexity</Strong></a>: cyclomatic complexity after structured programming constructs have been removed.<p><a name="Lines"><strong>Lines</Strong></a>: total lines (in a function or file or project)<p><a name="Blank"><strong>Lines Blank</Strong></a>: total lines without any code/comment <p><a name="Code"><strong>Lines Code</Strong></a>: total lines that have any code on them<p><a name="Comment"><strong>Lines Comment</Strong></a>: total lines that have comments on them<p><a name="Lines-dec"><strong>Lines Declarative</Strong></a>: total lines that have declarative code on them<p><a name="Lines-exe"><strong>Lines Executable</Strong></a>: total lines that have executable code on them<p><a name="Modified"><strong>Modified</strong></a>: cyclomatic except each case statement is not counted;the entire switch counts as 1 <p><a name="Nesting"><strong>Nesting</Strong></a>: maximum nesting level of control constucts (if, while,etc.)<p><a name="PathCount"><strong>Path Count</Strong></a>: Number of unique paths through a body of code (not counting gotos or abnormal exits.<p><a name="PathCountLog"><strong>Path Count Log</Strong></a>: Log10, truncated to an integer value, of the metric CountPath.<p><a name="PComment"><strong>Ratio Comment/Code</strong></a>: comment lines / code lines<p><a name="Strict"><strong>Strict</strong></a>: Cyclomatic complexity except each short-circuit operator adds 1 to the complexity.<p><a name="StrictModifiedEssential"><strong>Strict Modified Essential</Strong></a>: essential complexity except short-circuit operators add to complexity and structured case branches do not add to complexity.<p><a name="Stmt-exe"><strong>Statements executable</Strong></a>: total statements in executable code<p><a name="Stmt-dec"><strong>Statements declarative</Strong></a>: total statements in declarative code<p>Note, code+comment+blank != lines, as some lines might  have both code and comment</html></body><p><a name="Units"><strong>Units</strong></a>: Number of program units or functions.</pre></body></html>
