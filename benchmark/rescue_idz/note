According to the test on 20230406, the RESCUE of BOBYQA and IDZ of NEWUOA/LINCOA affects the
performance marginally. The settings of the test are as follows.

1. Test problems: the CUTEst set.
2. Maximum dimension: 200.
3. Maximum number of linear constraints for LINCOA: 20000.
4. Tested features: plain, randomizex0-eps, perm, single, dnoise-1.0e-6, sifnif5, noise-1.0e-4.
5. Number of random tests when applicable: 3.
6. RHOEND: 1.0e-8.
7. Maximum number of function evaluations: 500*dimension.
8. Tolerance for the convergence tests in the performance profiles: 10^{-i}, i = 1, ..., 16.

Note that we purposely set the stopping criteria and convergence tolerance to observe the long-term
behavior of the algorithms, as the techniques under consideration do not take effect unless we ask
for very high precision.

The result: RESCUE and IDZ do not affect the performance of the algorithms significantly. For
the classical version (i.e., Powell's implementation), the difference is barely observable. For the
modernized version, the difference is more obvious, but still not significant.

Therefore, it seems safe to ignore these two techniques in the first implementation of algorithms
based on the derivative-free PSB.
